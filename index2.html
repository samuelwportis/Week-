            <h4>Blue Fish</h4>
            <p>
                <span>Many prefer blue fish to other red fish, however many avid fishers would disagree. The disaggreement is sparked from the quality of the meat compared to the visual beauty of the fish. Oddly enough, it can also be said that blue fish carry happier vibes than red or green fish, this however can be disputed on the grounds that fish carrying vibes may not be possible.</span>
